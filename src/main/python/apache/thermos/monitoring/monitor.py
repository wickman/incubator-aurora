"""Monitor the state of Thermos tasks on a system

This module contains the TaskMonitor, used to reconstruct the state of active or finished Thermos
tasks based on their checkpoint streams. It exposes two key pieces of information about a Task, both
as their corresponding Thrift structs:
  - a RunnerState, representing the latest state of the Task
  - a list of ProcessStates, representing the processes currently running within the Task
