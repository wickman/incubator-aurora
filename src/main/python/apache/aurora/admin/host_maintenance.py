  Aurora provides a two-tiered concept of Maintenance. The first step is to initiate maintenance,

  that will be operated upon during this maintenance window).  Once all hosts have been tagged in
  this manner, the operator can begin draining individual machines, which will have all user-tasks
  killed and rescheduled.  When the tasks get placed onto a new machine, the scheduler will first
  look for hosts that do not have the maintenance tag, which will help decrease churn and prevent a
  task from being constantly killed as its hosts go down from underneath it.
